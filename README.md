# Todo-list Front end Mentor Challenge

I built this todo app as part of a front end mentor challenge. This project is built with css flexbox and react. I have used Concepts like Context.

## How to view the website

The website can be viewed at : https://todolist-fm.netlify.app/

### Things I learned from building this project

1. I learnt about Context and How to use it to prevent Prop drilling.
2. I learnt about setting max-width and how to prevent the todo app for stretching all the way.
3. I learnt about Conditional Rendering In React.
4. I also learnt about the concept of children.
